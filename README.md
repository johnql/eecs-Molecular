Quantum Chemistry - molecular properties prediction


ABSTRACT
Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to gain insight into a
molecule’s structure and dynamics depends on the ability to accurately predict so-called “scalar couplings”. These are effectively
the magnetic interactions between a pair of atoms. The strength
of this magnetic interaction depends on intervening electrons and
chemical bonds that make up a molecule’s three-dimensional structure. Using state-of-the-art methods from quantum mechanics, it is
possible to accurately calculate scalar coupling constants with a 3D
molecular structure as input. However, these quantum mechanics
calculations are extremely expensive. Sometimes these calculations
take days or weeks to complete and therefore have limited applicability in day-to-day workflows. A fast and reliable method to
predict these interactions will allow medicinal chemists to gain
structural insights in a faster and cheaper way, enabling scientists
to understand how the 3D chemical structure of a molecule affects
its properties and behavior. Ultimately, such tools will enable researchers to make progress in a range of important problems, like
designing molecules to carry out specific cellular tasks or designing
better drug molecules to fight disease.
